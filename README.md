# 911 Call Analysis Project
# Overview
This project involves analyzing 911 call data to gain insights into emergency incidents. The dataset contains information on various types of emergencies, their locations, timestamps, and other relevant details. The analysis aims to identify trends, patterns, and potential areas for improvement in emergency response.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes the following columns:

lat: Latitude of the call
lng: Longitude of the call
desc: Description of the emergency
zip: Zip code where the call was made
title: Title of the emergency
timeStamp: Time when the call was made
twp: Township where the call was made
addr: Address where the call was made
e: Emergency code

## Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/911-call-analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd 911-call-analysis
Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
## Data Cleaning
To clean the data, run the following script:

python scripts/data_cleaning.py
This script will handle missing values, incorrect data types, and any other data preprocessing steps.

## Data Exploration
To explore the data, open and run the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb
This notebook contains initial data exploration and summary statistics.

## Data Visualization
For visualizing the data, run the following script or open the corresponding notebook:

python scripts/data_visualization.py
jupyter notebook notebooks/data_visualization.ipynb
This will generate various plots and graphs to help understand the distribution and trends in the data.

## Predictive Modeling
To build and evaluate predictive models, run the script or open the notebook:

jupyter notebook notebooks/predictive_modeling.ipynb
This part includes training machine learning models to predict the nature or location of emergencies based on historical data.
